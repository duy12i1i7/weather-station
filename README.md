# Using DHT and ESP to visualise on the webserver
In this project, you’ll build an ESP32 or ESP8266 client that makes an HTTP POST request to a PHP script to insert data (sensor readings) into a MySQL database.

You’ll also have a web page that displays the sensor readings, timestamps, and other information from the database. You can visualize your data from anywhere in the world by accessing your own server.

As an example, we’ll be using a BME280 sensor connected to an ESP32 or ESP8266 board. You can modify the code provided to send readings from a different sensor or use multiple boards.

In order to create and build this project, you’ll use these technologies:

- ESP32 or ESP8266 programmed with Arduino IDE
- Hosting server and domain name
- PHP script to insert data into MySQL and display it on a web page
- MySQL database to store readings
